1) DESCRIPTION


The lti-freq-domain-toolbox is a collection of functions written in Racket, which lets Control Systems engineers study LTI (linear time-invariant) dynamical systems - from PID controllers to more complex systems.

It can perform tasks such as:
- computation of the overall transfer function (tf) of a system that is modeled by interconnected tfs in the s-domain
- generation of its Bode and Nyquist plots
- numerical computation of its time domain response




2) TO USE
      

1. Get Racket from: http://racket-lang.org and install

2. After you run DrRacket, open: File -> Install Package
   and paste: lti-freq-domain-toolbox in the "Package Source" field,
   to automatically download the package

3. Type in the definitions (left/upper part of the screen):
   
   #lang racket
   (require lti-freq-domain-toolbox)

   to load the package, and run with Ctrl+R

4. Type in the interactions / REPL (right/lower part of the screen):

   (run-examples)

   and press Enter to test all the examples of "main.rkt", and get a feeling of 
   how the program works.

5. To read the documentation of the package, open: Help -> Racket Documentation
   and paste: lti-freq-domain-toolbox in the "search manuals" field
