1) DESCRIPTION

lti-freq-domain-toolbox implements some basic functions for dealing with tasks such as:
computation of the transfer function (tf) of a lti system modeled by interconnected tf blocks 
in the s-domain, generation of bode & nyquist plots, and arithmetic computation of its time-domain response.




2) QUICKSTART FOR NEW USERS OF RACKET
      

1. Get Racket from: racket-lang.org and install

2. After you run DrRacket, install the lti-freq-domain-toolbox package by: 
   File->Install Package->Browse->Directory (select folder)

3. Type: (require lti-freq-domain-toolbox) in the top of the definitions 
   (left or upper part of screen), just below the #lang line

4. Run your program with Ctrl+R

5. Type in the interactions (right or lower part of screen): (run-examples)
   and then press Enter to run all the examples of "main.rkt".




3) HELP/GUIDELINES/NOTES


Ã‰.   Open "main.rkt" to run each example and get a feeling of how the program works, 
     ex. type: (bode (feedback-loop-test1 a))

II.  Build blocks to install inside them the transfer functions (tfs), so as to achieve abstraction

III. The blocks a, b, c, d are predefined for speed

IV.  Do not use parentheses when giving names for elements

V.   Use as input in the functions supplied (bode, compare etc) the names of the blocks,
     not the tfs, always without parentheses

VI.  Delay can be modeled in two ways: 
     i)  by approximating it using pade functions (for both s- and t-domain)
     ii) by adding delay as a function of w by defining a fw function (mainly for the s-domain)

VII. Custom built functions that create circuits, like circuit1 or pid, can be made
     so that they return the block, so the can be used directly as inputs to functions like bode etc.
     That isn't the case when using the function tf to build a function, 
     because tf does not return the block where it is installed

VIII.The connection of two tfs or adders has no effect if they are not elements of the same block.
     Blocks can themselves be connected

IX.  If all elements inside a block are not connected, the value of the block's total tf
     is that of the latest installed

X.   Do not simplify a block that has empty blocks inside it 
     - build new blocks just when they are needed

XI.  Implementation assumption: each tf, adder or block has only one input and multiple outputs.
     Multiple inputs can be achieved by adding in front of it an adder

XII. Restart the program before working with new circuits defined on already used blocks
