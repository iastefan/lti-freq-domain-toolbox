@defmodule[lti-freq-domain-toolbox]


The @bold{lti-freq-domain-toolbox} is a collection of functions written in Racket, which lets Control Systems engineers study LTI (linear time-invariant) dynamical systems - from PID controllers to more complex systems.

It can perform tasks such as:

@itemlist[@item{computation of the overall transfer function (tf) of a system that is modeled by interconnected tfs in the s-domain}
          @item{generation of its Bode and Nyquist plots}
          @item{numerical computation of its time domain response}]

@section[#:tag "representation"]{Representing a dynamical system}


@subsection[#:tag "introduction"]{Introduction}

A linear time-invariant (LTI) dynamical system is represented as a circuit of interconnected elements: transfer functions (tfs), adders and blocks.

Blocks are used to install inside them elements (tfs, adders and other blocks), as a means for achieving abstraction.

@subsection[#:tag "elements"]{Elements}




@defproc[(block [b1 block?])
         block?]{
                 
 @margin-note{
  @bold{Implementation assumption:}
 
  @italic{Each block of elements has only one input (another tf, adder or block) and multiple outputs.}

  @italic{Multiple inputs can be achieved by adding in front of it an adder.}
 }

 A block of elements is a means for achieving abstraction. Circuit elements such as transfer functions (tfs), adders and other blocks
 can be "stored" inside a block, and form a whole that can be handled as an element itself.

 A new block is defined using the @racket[block] procedure. A parent block inside which the block is stored can be optionally specified.

 @racketblock[(define new-block1 (block c))
              (define new-block2 (block))]

 The four blocks a, b, c, d are predefined for speed. Blocks themeselves can be installed inside other blocks:

 @racketblock[(define new-block-inside-block-a (block d))]

 Notes:
 @itemlist[@item{Build new blocks only when needed and if there are elements to be stored inside}
           @item{If all the elements inside a block are @bold{not} connected, the value of the block's overall tf is that of the 
             latest stored}
           @item{Re-run the program before defining new circuits in already used blocks}]
}


 

@defproc[(tf [nom-coeffs (listof real?)] [denom-coeffs (listof real?)] [b1 block?])
         tf?]{

 @margin-note{
  @bold{Implementation assumption:}
 
  @italic{Each tf has only one input (another tf, adder or block) and multiple outputs.}

  @italic{Multiple inputs can be achieved by adding in front of it an adder.}
 }

 To define a @bold{transfer function}, the lists of the coefficients of its nominator and denominator polynomials, as well as
 the block it belongs to must be specified, using the @racket[tf] procedure.

 @racketblock[(define new-tf1 (tf '(4 3 6) '(2 1) b))]
}




@defproc[(adder [b1 block?])
         adder?]{

 @margin-note{
  @bold{Implementation assumption:}
 
  @italic{Each adder has multiple inputs and multiple outputs}
 }

 An adder is an element used to add multiple input signals, and provide one or multiple outputs.
 It can be placed in front of a block or tf, to provide them with multiple inputs. An adder is created and placed inside a bloc using the
 @racket[adder] procedure.

 @racketblock[(define tf1 (tf '(1 0) '(2 1 0) b))
              (define tf2 (tf '(5 0) '(5 1 0) b))
              (define new-adder1 (adder b))
              (connect tf1 new-adder1)
              (connect tf2 new-adder1)]
}




@subsection[#:tag "connecting-elements"]{Connecting elements}

Elements (tfs, adders and blocks) are connected @bold{serially} using the @racket[connect] procedure:

@defproc[(connect [e1 element?] [e2 element?])
         element?]{

 @racketblock[(connect tf1 tf2)             
              (connect tf2 adder1)
              (connect tf3 adder1)
              (connect a b)]

 The connection of two elements has no effect if they are not elements of the same block.

 Complex connection designs can be achieved by defining all serial connections between elements.

@section[#:tag "plot-functions"]{Plot functions}

@margin-note{ 
 @italic{All plot functions listed below take as inputs blocks, not transfer functions.}
}

@subsection[#:tag "frequency-domain"]{Frequency domain}

@defproc[(bode [b1 block?])
         void?]{

 The @racket[bode] function takes as input a block, and - after simplifying it if needed - prints its tf, Bode magnitude and phase plots,
 and characteristic numbers.

 @racketblock[(bode (pd-controller 5 8 a))]
}




@defproc[(compare [b1 block?] [b2 block?])
         void?]{

 The @racket[compare] function takes as inputs two @bold{different} blocks, and - after simplifying them if needed - prints their comparative tfs,
 Bode magnitude and phase plots.

 @racketblock[(define c1 (block))
              (define c2 (block))
              (define tf1 (tf '(1) '(1 0 1) c1))
              (define tf2 (tf '(5) '(1 0 1) c2))
              (compare c1 c2)
              (compare (pid-controller 6 7 3 a) (pi-controller 7 8 b))]

 The latter example works because a PID function is defined so that it returns as a result the block in which it is installed in.
}




@defproc[(evolve [b1 block?])
         void?]{

 The @racket[evolve] function takes as input a block, and - after simplifying them if needed - prints its tf and its Bode magnitude and phase plots,
 storing the results. The next time it is called, it prints the current block's Bode plot on top of the last one stored. 

 @racketblock[(evolve (pid-controller 6 7 3 a))
              (evolve (pid-controller 5 20 4 a))]
}




@defproc[(tune [b1 block?] [condition list?] [freq positive?])
         void?]{

 The @racket[tune] function can be used in order to compute the value of a single system's parameter, so that the system achieves a specific performance.
 It takes as inputs a block, an equality condition regarding the @bold{amplitude response AR} or the @bold{phase shift ph},
 and the frequency at which this equality condition must be satisfied.

 The function prints the value of the parameter computed, and the Bode magnitude and phase plots for the system.

 @racketblock[(tune (pi-controller 5 'y a) '(= AR 140) 0.01)
              (tune (pi-controller 5 'y a) '(= ph -50) 0.01)]
}




@defproc[(nyquist [b1 block?])
         void?]{

 The @racket[nyquist] function takes as input a block, and - after simplifying it if needed - prints its tf, Nyquist plot, and characteristic numbers.

 @racketblock[(define tf1 (tf '(1) '(1 1 1) a))
              (nyquist a)]
}




@subsection[#:tag "time-domain"]{Time domain}

@defproc[(step [b1 block?] [gain real?])
         void?]{

 The @racket[step] function takes as inputs a block and a gain number, and - after simplifying the block if needed - prints the block's tf,
 the block's tf with gain added, and the step time response of the system.

 @racketblock[(step (sine a) 5)
              (define tf2 (tf '(1) '(0.3 0.1 1) b))
              (step b 5)]
}




@defproc[(impulse [b1 block?])
         void?]{

 The @racket[impulse] function takes as inputs a block, and - after simplifying it if needed - prints the block's tf, and its impulse time response.

 @racketblock[(impulse (sine a))
              (define tf2 (tf '(1) '(0.3 0.1 1) b))
              (impulse b)]
}




@defproc[(trajectory [b1 block?])
         void?]{

 The @racket[trajectory] function takes as inputs a block, and - after simplifying it if needed - prints the block's tf,
 and its time domain df(t)/dt - f(t) trajectory plot.

 @racketblock[(trajectory (sine a))
              (define tf2 (tf '(1) '(0.3 0.1 1) b))
              (trajectory b)]
}






@;//////////   Section 3   //////////


@section[#:tag "predefined-circuits"]{Predefined circuits}

Circuits can be defined so that they return as a result the block they are stored in. Therefore, as an exception,
they can be used directly as inputs to functions:
   
@racketblock[(bode (feedback-loop-test1 a))]

instead of:

@racketblock[(feedback-loop-test1 a)
             (bode a)]

That isn't the case when using tfs, because a tf does not return the block in which it is installed.



@subsection[#:tag "Basic components"]{Basic components}

@defproc[(integrator [b1 block?])
         block?]

@racketblock[(bode (integrator a))]




@defproc[(sine [b1 block?])
         block?]

@racketblock[(bode (sine a))]




@defproc[(phase-delay-circuit [b1 block?])
         block?]

@racketblock[(bode (phase-delay-circuit a))]




@subsection[#:tag "ControllerS"]{Controllers}

The PI, PD and PID controllers are defined by specifying the proportional (kp), integral (ki) and derivative (kd) gains in the respective cases:

@defproc[(pi-controller [kp real?] [ki real?] [b1 block?])
         block?]

@racketblock[(bode (pi-controller 5 8 a))]




@defproc[(pd-controller [kp real?] [kd real?] [b1 block?])
         block?]

@racketblock[(bode (pd-controller 5 8 a))]




@defproc[(pid-controller [kp real?] [ki real?] [kd real?] [b1 block?])
         block?]

@racketblock[(bode (pid-controller 5 8 4 a))]




@subsection[#:tag "Filters"]{Filters} 

A Chebyshev Type I filter is defined by specifying the polynomial order (n), ripple factor (e) and cutoff frequency (w0) parameters:

@defproc[(chebyshev-type1 [n exact-positive-integer?] [e real?] [w0 positive?] [b1 block?])
         block?]

@racketblock[(bode (chebyshev-type1 6 1 1 a))]




@subsection[#:tag "Delay components"]{Delay components}

Delay can be modeled in two ways:
@itemlist[@item{by approximating it using a Pad√© polynomial}
          @item{by adding delay as a function f(w) of the frequency w in the overall block's tf (only for the s-domain)}]

A time delay component, modeled by a Pad√© polynomial of order [6/6] approximating the function e^(-t), can be added to the block using the function:

@defproc[(pade-delay [b1 block?] [t positive?])
         block?]

@racketblock[(step (pade-delay (sine a) 5) 1)]
